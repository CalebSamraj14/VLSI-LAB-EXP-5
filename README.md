SIMULATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF FINITE STATE MACHINE

AIM: To simulate and synthesis finite state machine using vivado2023.3.

**APPARATUS REQUIRED:**

vivado 2023.3

**PROCEDURE:**

STEP:1 Start the Xilinx navigator, Select and Name the New project.
STEP:2 Select the device family, device, package and speed. 
STEP:3 Select new source in the New Project and select Verilog Module as the Source type. 
STEP:4 Type the File Name and Click Next and then finish button. Type the code and save it. 
STEP:5 Select the Behavioral Simulation in the Source Window and click the check syntax. 
STEP:6 Click the simulation to simulate the program and give the inputs and verify the outputs as per the truth table. 
STEP:7 Select the Implementation in the Sources Window and select the required file in the Processes Window. 
STEP:8 Select Check Syntax from the Synthesize XST Process. Double Click in the Floorplan Area/IO/Logic-Post Synthesis process in the User Constraints process group. UCF(User constraint File) is obtained. 
STEP:9 In the Design Object List Window, enter the pin location for each pin in the Loc column Select save from the File menu. 
STEP:10 Double click on the Implement Design and double click on the Generate Programming File to create a bitstream of the design.(.v) file is converted into .bit file here. 
STEP:11 On the board, by giving required input, the LEDs starts to glow light, indicating the output.
STEP:12 Load the Bit file into the SPARTAN 6 FPGA

VERILOG CODE:
~~~
module Sequence_Detector_Moore(clock,reset,sequence_in,detector_out);
input clock, reset, sequence_in; 
output reg detector_out; 
parameter  S0=2'b00,S1=2'b01,S2=2'b10,S3=2'b11;
reg [1:0] current_state, next_state; 
// sequential memory of the Moore FSM
always @(posedge clock, posedge reset)
begin
 if(reset==1) 
 current_state <= S0;
 else
 current_state <= next_state; 
end 
// to determine next state 
always @(current_state,sequence_in)
begin
 case(current_state) 
 	S0:begin
		if(sequence_in==1)
   			next_state = S1;
  		else
   			next_state = S0;
 	   end
 	S1:begin
if(sequence_in==0)
   			next_state = S2;
  		else
   			next_state = S1;
 	   end
S2:begin
  	if(sequence_in==1)
   		next_state = S3;
 	 else
   		next_state = S0;
    end 
  S3:begin
  	if(sequence_in==0)
   		next_state = S0;
  	else
   		next_state = S1;
     end
	default:next_state = S0;
endcase
end
// to determine the output of the Moore FSM, output only depends on current state
always @(current_state)
begin 
 case(current_state) 
 	S0:   detector_out = 0;
 	S1:   detector_out = 0;
 	S2:  detector_out = 0;
 	S3:  detector_out = 1;
 	default:  detector_out = 0;
 endcase
end 
endmodule

OUTPUT:
![fsm11](https://github.com/CalebSamraj14/VLSI-LAB-EXP-5/assets/163808923/89457bfc-2a68-47e9-8a46-f26c4fbcb487)


RESULT:

thus the simulate and synthesis finite state machine using vivado2023.3 is verified
